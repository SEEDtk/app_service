I would say "no problem", but in fact it feels like the last time I used plain old Getopt::Long was another life. ??

Thanks for the factoring.

Subject: CLI Additional Services
Here is the list of services I was asked to implement.
 
•	*Comprehensive Genome Analysis
•	Tree
•	MSA
•	Rva Genotyper
•	*Codon Tree
•	BLAST
•	SNP-analysis
•	FastqUtils
•	*Metagenomic Read Mapping
•	Genome Comparison
•	*Taxonomic Classification
•	RNASeq Analysis
•	Variation Analysis
•	Ha Numbering
•	Metagenome Binning
•	Short-seqsearch
•	SARS-2 Genome Assembly and Annotation
 
I have parameter definitions for all the services shown in boldface.  The others might be available under a different name, may not yet be a service (BLAST), or may not exist yet.
 
We currently have two scripts, and each has its own unique way of processing.  There are common patterns-- file name normalization and upload, multiple FASTQ input sets, output path, and common parameters-- that I have set up library modules to handle.  This is so that I am not copying and pasting code between scripts and then making a dozen modifications to implement one fix.  With only two submission scripts, this was a problem Bob never faced.
 
Once this is all done, Taxonomic Classification and Comprehensive Genome Analysis should be very simple tasks.   There are other services that basically take FASTQ input-- RNASeq Analysis and Metagenomic Read Mapping-- but they have slightly different parameter structures, so they will require tweaking.   Once I get all the bold-face stuff done, I will need instructions for how to find the JSON specifications for the other services.  But that is not necessary now.
